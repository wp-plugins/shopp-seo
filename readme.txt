Ties together the functionality of WordPress SEO by Yoast with Shopp.

== Description ==

Shopp SEO is developed to bridge the gap between Shopp and WordPress SEO by Yoast. WordPress SEO by Yoast does not integrate with Shopp fully and this plugin fixes that.

Shopp SEO will provide you with meta fields for products and categories within Shopp. Most of the functionality of those fields is handled by WordPress SEO by Yoast and this plugin just provides that data to WordPress SEO by Yoast.

This plugin does remove the native functionality of Shopp with regards to meta descriptions on categories. Shopp creates a meta description for categories based off the category description and disregards WordPress SEO by Yoast. This plugin fixes that so only one meta description is created on a category and that is the one setup by WordPress SEO by Yoast.

Lastly, this plugin adds in the ability for you to setup SEO titles and descriptions for Shopp areas you couldn't otherwise SEO, like the Shopp landing page, account page, collections and more.
